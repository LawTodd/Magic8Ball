The magic 8 ball will shake when you click on it then give you a random answer from the list of 5 answers.

I used a random number generator to pick the answer from an array.

I also used a random number generator to get the number of pixels to move the 8 ball both down and to the left from the starting position to create the shaking animation.

When the button is cliked I show a message saying "The Magic 8 Ball is searching for your answer!" while the ball shakes.  Then it displays the answer, then it resets to the original message after 3 seconds.
